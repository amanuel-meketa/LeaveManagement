The Leave Management Software employs a Clean Architecture, integrating layers for easy maintenance and testing while ensuring separation of concerns. It incorporates the Repository Pattern to abstract data access, promoting flexibility and testability. Furthermore, the software adopts CORS for secure cross-origin requests and middleware like the Mediator pattern, centralizing communication for loose coupling and scalability. This comprehensive approach enhances functionality, adaptability, and effective management of employee leave.
